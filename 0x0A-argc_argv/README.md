0x0A-argc_argv
command line arguments. So far we have been using our main function without having to pass any arguments, but like any other function
the main function too takes in arguments.
The command ilne arguments passed by main are ;
argc - argument count
-it stores the number of command line arguments passed by the user including the name of the program
argv - argument vector
- it is an array of character pointers listing all the arguments
